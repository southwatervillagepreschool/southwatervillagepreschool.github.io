<!-- #### children starting from September 2023 -->

We are thrilled to invite you to our preschool open day on Monday, May 15th, from 10:00am until noon. This is your chance to explore our exceptional facilities and see what sets our preschool apart.

We have exciting news to share with you! We recently completed our brand new outdoor sheltered learning area, featuring an all-weather garden and playground. With free-flow garden access, your children can enjoy fresh air and playtime no matter what the weather is like.

We hope that you can join us for this event and experience firsthand the remarkable learning opportunities that our preschool has to offer.

We look forward to seeing you on Monday the 15th of May.
