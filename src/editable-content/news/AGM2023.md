Please show your support by joining us at Southwater Village Hall Preschool this years AGM.

The AGM usually takes about half an hour and starts at 7:30 at the village hall. If you would like a copy of the previous AGM minutes or accounts prior to the meeting, please email: [office@southwatervillagepreschool.org](mailto:office@southwatervillagepreschool.org)

The Constitution of Southwater Village Hall Pre-School states that an AGM should be held in the autumn term of each year in line with the national guidance from the Early Years Alliance. Please note that if numbers of parents attending are insufficient, pre-school will have to arrange a new AGM with enough attending.

This is your chance to get involved in how the preschool is run, by joining the committee that works closely with the staff and management to make the preschool, a fun and safe place for your children to learn and play.
