#### Our AGM will be Held on Tuesday 15th November 2022

Please show your support by joining us at Southwater Village Hall Preschool for our AGM. Find out how our year has gone and hear from our Manager, Heather Clarke, as she shares her annual report.

This informative evening is really important and lasts for approximately thirty minutes and will start at **7:30pm** in the rear room of the village hall. It's vital we have parents attend to allow preschool to remain open.

Please consider volunteering to join committee. Get involved with decisions that directly impact your child. Contact Heather for further information.
Full details will be sent to all parents/carers.
