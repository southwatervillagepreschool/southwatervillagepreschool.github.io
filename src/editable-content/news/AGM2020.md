#### Our AGM will be Held on 17 October 2020

Please show your support by joining us at the Southwater Village Hall Preschool virtual AGM. Find out how our year has gone and hear from our Manager, Heather Clarke, as she shares her annual report.

This informative evening is really important and lasts for approximately thirty minutes using Zoom. It's vital we have parents attend to allow preschool to remain open.

Please consider volunteering to join committee. Get involved with decisions that directly impact your child. Contact Heather for further information.
Full details will be sent to all parents/carers after half term.
