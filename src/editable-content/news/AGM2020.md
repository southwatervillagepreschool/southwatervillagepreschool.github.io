#### Our AGM will be Held on 16th November 2021

Please show your support by joining us at the Southwater Village Hall Preschool Zoom AGM. Find out how our year has gone and hear from our Manager, Heather Clarke, as she shares her annual report.

This informative evening is really important and lasts for approximately thirty minutes using Zoom and will start at __7:30pm__. It's vital we have parents attend to allow preschool to remain open.

Please consider volunteering to join committee. Get involved with decisions that directly impact your child. Contact Heather for further information.
Full details will be sent to all parents/carers.
