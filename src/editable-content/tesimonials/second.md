My son loves it here. The staff are very caring and always provide such fun activities for them.
I love the fact they have online journals so I get pictures of what my son is up to during the day ðŸ¥°
Emma has been so kind and helpful with getting my son in and settled, I would highly recommend this preschool. Oh and the garden is amazing for the children.
