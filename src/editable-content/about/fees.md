### Fees for under 3s and for children accessing hours above the funded 15 hours from September 2023

|                   |        |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Morning Session   | £20.00 |
| Lunch Link        | £7.00  |
| Afternoon Session | £20.00 |
| Adhoc Session     | £20.00 |

Fees are due in by the end of the second week of the term. Unfortunately, we are unable to give refunds if for any reason a child is unable to attend. If fees are not paid promptly, the committee reserve the right to refuse your child a place.

We are happy to take online payments (please show the name of child) or Employee Childcare Vouchers Fees (these usually provide tax savings). We are registered with a range of voucher providers. We can provide further information on request.

If you pay by cash or cheque then these should always be in a sealed envelope with your child’s name clearly marked on the front. Please also write ‘fees’ on the front of the envelope.

### Lunch Link

![children activity](../../images/086.jpg)

<!-- We have introduced a Lunch Link session for over 3s, which provides the option for children to eat their lunch at Pre-School. The experience of eating lunch in the Pre-School setting helps to develop children’s social skills and independence before they move on to ‘big school’. -->

Attending Lunch Link gives the opportunity to attend Pre-School for the whole day or a longer morning/afternoon session on a Monday, Tuesday or Thursday.

Parents/Carers provide their child with a packed lunch in line with our Lunch Link Policy. Lunch Link fees are £7.00 per session and are not currently covered by government funding. The fees are payable termly in advance and are due by the end of the second week of term.

### Free Entitlement Funding

In line with the current guidelines regarding funding, children are fully funded for up to five sessions per week (dependent on availability), from the term following their 3rd birthday.
