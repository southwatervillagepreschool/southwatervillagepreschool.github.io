We aim to provide children with great care and attention from qualified staff, as well as volunteer parent helpers. We want children to join with other children and adults to live, play, work and learn together.</p>\n<p>Sessions are organised so that children can choose from, and work at, a variety of activities and, in doing so, build up their ability to select and work through a task to completion. The children are also helped and encouraged to take part in adult-led small and large group activities, which introduce them to new experiences and help them to gain new skills, as well as helping them to learn to work with others.</p>\n<p>We see parents as partners in helping each child to learn and develop. Our pre-school recognises parents as the first and most important educators of their children. Parents are seen as partners in providing care and education for their children.</p>\n<p>We currently operate from two halls within the Village Hall. We are registered with Ofsted for up to 42 children. In 2020 we have a brand new, large and dedicated outside fenced play area.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"about us","hideHero":null}},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/7568320ea1fcfb0b6836bae16c6af3c6/52317/2023_1.png","srcSet":"/static/7568320ea1fcfb0b6836bae16c6af3c6/69585/2023_1.png 200w,\n/static/7568320ea1fcfb0b6836bae16c6af3c6/497c6/2023_1.png 400w,\n/static/7568320ea1fcfb0b6836bae16c6af3c6/52317/2023_1.png 693w","sizes":"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/aboutmain/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2987686015","3431546305","3431546305"]}
